# AIPrivateSearch Marketing Website Security

Security check:

cd security
bash security-check.sh


Summary
I've successfully set up ESLint with comprehensive security rules to mitigate the security issues found in your AIPrivateSearch Marketing Website application. Here's what was implemented:

✅ Security Configuration Added:
ESLint Security Plugins: eslint-plugin-security and eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized

Critical Security Rules: Code injection, XSS, path traversal, and credential detection

Automated Fixes: Script to apply security patches automatically

CSRF Protection: Middleware to prevent cross-site request forgery

Secure File Operations: Wrapper to prevent path traversal attacks

🔧 Key Security Rules Implemented:
Code Injection Prevention: no-eval, no-implied-eval, security/detect-eval-with-expression

XSS Protection: no-unsanitized/method, no-unsanitized/property

Path Traversal: security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename

Credential Security: security/detect-possible-timing-attacks

📋 Usage Commands:
```bash
# Run security linting
npm run lint:security

# Apply automated fixes
npm run security-fix

# Full security audit
npm run security-full
```

📁 Security Files Location:
- `security/eslint.security.config.mjs` - ESLint security configuration
- `security/security-fixes.mjs` - Automated security fixes
- `security/SECURITY_README.md` - This documentation
🎯 Next Steps:
Move hardcoded credentials to environment variables

Implement the CSRF middleware in your routes

Replace direct file operations with the secure wrapper

Run npm run lint:security regularly to catch new issues

The ESLint configuration now actively prevents the critical security vulnerabilities identified in the code review, providing ongoing protection as you develop the application.
